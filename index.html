    <h3 style="color: red;">What is CSS</h3>
    <p>1. CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
    <p>2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</p>
    <p>3. <font class="m"> Css is not necesssary</font> <font class="n"> Css saves a lot of work.</font>It can control the layout of multiple webpage all at once.</p>
    <p>4. <font class="o">Extrenal stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</font>  </p>

<h3 style="color: red;">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>

<ul type="bullet" class="ul">
    <li >Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental </li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an extrenal CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external css file . However, <font class="n">in this tutorial  we will use inline and internal styles.</font>  because this is easier to demostrate. and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that css class applies a class to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by java script.  </p>
<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a special element or range of elements on web page. Once an element an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.  </p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectorts available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
